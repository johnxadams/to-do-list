1. _After creating a basic HTML skeleton with form > input - the magic happens in java-script_

2. _Inside the arrow-Fn addToList I declared a variable called userdata, which captures the value of the users Input. Only if (user's input is not empty..) {..create a new element "newList"(li) and also create a new textNode. The textNode will be added to the newList(li) on each new input.} All the rest is mostly decoration._
